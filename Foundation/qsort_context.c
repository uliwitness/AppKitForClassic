 *		qsort
 *
 *	Implementation
 *	--------------
 *
 *		Here we use Heapsort, after Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 3",
 *		Section 5.2.3. Heapsort was chosen because it requires no auxiliary storage and
 *		has excellent average *and* worst-case performance.
 *
 *	Future Enhancements
 *	-------------------
 *		
 *		Although this algorithm is theoretically efficient, it is not as efficient
 *		as it could be for certain special cases. Specifically, the Swap routine
 *		could be more efficient in the same way memcpy et al. could be, i.e., by
 *		moving longs instead of bytes whenever possible. This would only be
 *		beneficial with a large member_size, though.
 *		
 *		For smaller member_size's, many Swap operations could be eliminated
 *		entirely. We swap on each iteration through the 'sift' operation even
 *		though, in theory, we can pick up a value before the loop, put it in a
 *		temporary, and drop it in its final destination after the loop. Where we
 *		now swap in the loop, we would merely need to replace:
 *		
 *		   swap(ip,jp,member_size);
 *		
 *		with:
 *		
 *		   memcpy(ip,jp,member_size);
 *		
 *		which involves less work.
 *		
 *		We do the swap because we don't know, in general, how big a temporary we
 *		would be needing. We could conceivably malloc a temporary as needed and
 *		resort to the algorithm used here only when we can't get the memory
 *		needed. However, for reasonably small member_size's, say <= 64, we could
 *		use a statically allocated temporary.
 *		
 *		And finally, we can squeeze a lot of cycles for the special cases of
 *		member_size's of 1, 2, and 4 bytes, where we could presumably use a
 *		register for the temporary.
 *
 *
 *	18-Jul-95 JFH  First code release.
 *	04-Dec-95 JFH  Fixed small (!) bug in PPC version of swap. Was
 *								 pre-incrementing on store instead of fetch.
